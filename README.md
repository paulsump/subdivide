# subdivide

A football created from a truncated icosahedron. I want full control and understanding of where the
vertices are, in order to do the final part of pushing out each patch of the bucky ball, like how a
football is stitched together, so I created it from scratch...

### First step: Spherical coordinates

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron)
"The locations of the vertices of a regular icosahedron can be described using spherical
coordinates, for instance as latitude and longitude. If two vertices are taken to be at the north
and south poles (latitude ±90°), then the other ten vertices are at latitude ± arctan(0.5) =
±26.57°. These ten vertices are at evenly spaced longitudes (36° apart), alternating between north
and south latitudes.

This scheme takes advantage of the fact that the regular icosahedron is a pentagonal gyroelongated
bipyramid"... .
