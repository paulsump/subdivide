# subdivide

Ultimately planning to create a football from a truncated icosahedron.
I can load and render one from an obj file already, but I want full control and understanding of where the 
vertices are, in order to do the final part of pushing out each face, like how a football is stiched
together, so I'm going to create it from scratch, which means

create phi (golden ratio) constant
create coordinates for tetrahedron (top half of octahedron)
create coords of top half of icosahedron by finding 'midpoint'
along tetrahedron's edges, where 'midpoint' is the golden ratio.

## Getting Started
